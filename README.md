# Django.py_REAL_ESTATE

This is a simple real estate web-site with filtering homes. It was built in the Python language with Bootstrap UI-library and Django framework

Demo: https://octave-brokerage.herokuapp.com/

I had some distribution code, templates and some CSS but I have to implement a lot:
- essential refactoring of the code
- cosmetic improvements
- web-hosting on Heroku + AWS_S3 instead of DigitalOcean. 

Requirements
- Python 3.6 & up
- Virtual Environment (pipenv)
- PostgreSQL
- Git
- Heroku account
- Amazon AWS account
